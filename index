Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 15 December 2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Loadcounter (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

2. Information We Collect
2.1 Location Data

GPS Coordinates:
The app collects precise location data (latitude and longitude) to enable geofencing features for automatic load counting.

Real-Time Location Processing:
Location data is processed in real time to detect when you enter or exit predefined collection point zones.

Background Location:
The app may access location data in the background to continuously monitor geofence boundaries, even when the app is not in the foreground.

2.2 Job and Work Data

Project Information:
Project names, job start and end times, and tracking data (hours, kilometers, or miles).

Load Data:
Load counts, timestamps, and payload measurements (area, weight, volume) with associated units.

Time Tracking:
Idle time and motion time calculated based on GPS movement patterns.

Hobbs Meter Readings:
Start and end meter readings used for job tracking.

2.3 Geofence Data

Collection Points:
Custom locations you create, including names, coordinates, radius settings, and stationary delay configurations.

Geofence Status:
Active or inactive status of collection points.

2.4 App Preferences

Theme preferences (such as dark mode), tutorial completion status, and instruction panel visibility settings.

2.5 Purchase Information

In-App Purchases:
Purchase IDs and transaction status for ad-removal purchases, processed securely through Google Play.

2.6 Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:

Names, email addresses, or phone numbers

Account credentials or authentication data

Payment card or banking information

Contacts, photos, or other device files

3. How We Use Your Information

Time Tracking: Calculate idle and motion time using GPS movement

3.2 App Features

4. Data Storage
4.1 Local-Only Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Android’s local storage mechanisms.

No cloud storage

No external servers

No account syncing

Your data remains on your device until you:

Delete the app

Delete jobs or geofences within the app

Clear app data via device settings

4.2 Data Ownership

You fully own and control your data. You may export job data as PDF files or delete any stored information at any time.

5. Third-Party Services
5.1 Google Maps

Purpose: Interactive maps and location rendering
Data Shared: Location coordinates and geofence markers
Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Device information

Advertising ID

We do not have access to or control over data collected directly by Google AdMob.

6. Location Data Details
6.1 Why Location Access Is Required

Enable geofencing for collection zones

Automatically count loads when leaving a zone

Display your current position on the map

6.2 Location Accuracy

The app uses high-accuracy location settings to ensure reliable geofencing.
Location data is processed in real time and not stored as a continuous location history.

6.3 Background Location Access

Background location access is essential to the core functionality of the app and cannot be replaced with foreground-only access. Load counting must occur automatically when the user exits a collection zone, even if the screen is off or the app is closed.

You may revoke location permissions at any time in device settings; doing so will disable geofencing and automatic load counting.

7. Data Sharing and Disclosure
7.1 No Sale of Data

We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.

7.2 Limited Sharing

Google Maps for map rendering

Google AdMob for advertising (if enabled)

Google Play Services for purchases

No job data, geofences, or work information is shared with other parties.

7.3 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our legal rights and safety.

8. Your Rights and Choices

Permissions: Grant or revoke location access at any time

Access: View all job and geofence data in the app

Deletion: Delete individual jobs or all app data

Ads: Remove ads permanently via in-app purchase

9. Data Security

All data is stored locally using Android’s storage systems. While reasonable security measures are used, no electronic storage method is completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device.

10. Children’s Privacy

Loadcounter is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

11. International Users

The app is operated from New Zealand.
All data is stored locally on your device regardless of location.
